GlassPad
========

The landing page for the futuristic GlassPad, made for UCLA [DMA 161 Fall 2014](http://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Fall14/161/) project #5 Build. http://zhxnlai.github.io/GlassPad/

Technologies involved
---
- [Pure](http://purecss.io/)
  - gird system, menu, button, and form.
- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) 
  - After the failed attempt to divide the entire website into react components(overkill), I simply use react to create header and footer and load the content for each section from HTML files using ajax.
