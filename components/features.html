			<h3>Scan anything.</h3>
			<p>The see-through technology on the GlassPad makes it extremely easy to scan anything

				you could possibly want to scan. With high tech scanners to identify and access to a

				huge online database of information, feel free to scan to find directions to a building in

				the distance, identify an animal from its footprints, or just find fun facts about the local

				landmark.</p>

				products, such as the GlassWall and the GlassPhone. By syncing, pictures, projects,

				even ongoing webcam conversations can easily be transferred between devices to

				make your day just that much easier.
